Apple II Speech Card using SP0256A-AL2

### Description
This is a speech card that I created for the Apple ][ computer in 1988 using the GI SP0256A-AL2 Speech Processor chip sold in RadioShack stores.
I used this card to develop the speech for a talking doorbell that I also designed using the same speech chip and the Intel i8741 microcontroller.
This talking doorbell was never made into a product, that is still something I might do in the future... who knows lol.

I hope the information here preserves the memories of the alien sounding speech technology that was available to hobbyists at RadioShack stores.

I retain all rights to the doorbell, otherwise have fun.
Please enjoy!
